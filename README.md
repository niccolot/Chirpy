# Chirpy

Implementation of a twitter-like RESTAPI. The endpoints permits to register a user, login, change credentials, post read and delete a 'chirp', aka tweet. 

In the app there are implemented endopints in order to register and user, change its credentials post/delete and list chirps. 

A fittitious webhook is implemented that changes the status of the account to the premium version **chirpy red**. 

### Authorizations and authentications

A system of authentication via JWTs is implemented (with an expire time of max 24 hours), with the relative refresh tokens (with an expire time of 60 days). The refresh token is rotated every time the user credentials are changed or the JWT are refreshed and they can be revoked with the apposite endpoint. The secret key for encripting the JWTs is stored in a `.env` file in the root of the repo.

The webhook endpoints authorization is implemented via an API key that is stored in a `.env` file in the root of the repo and the users passwords are stored in the database as hashed strings.

### Database 

The database is implemented using [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) with Go code generated by [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) and the database migrations handled by [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose).

### Errors

If an HTTP fails a response is given in the form

```json
{
    "error": "<error message with information relative to what happened and where>",
    "status code": 1 # whatever code may be 
}
```

Internal errors, e.g. fails to parse json, read some file, use some functions etc. are reported with the status code `500` and the relative message while more specific errors are listed in the endpoints below.

### Resources

```go
type User struct {
	Id        uuid.UUID `json:"id"`
	CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	UpdatedAt time.Time `json:"updated_at"`
	Email     string `json:"email"`
	HashedPassword string `json:"hashed_password"`
	IsChirpyred bool `json:"is_chirpy_red"`
}

type Chirp struct {
	Id        uuid.UUID `json:"id"`
	CreatedAt time.Time `json:"created_at"`
	UpdatedAt time.Time `json:"updated_at"`
	Body     string `json:"body"`
	UserId uuid.UUID `json:"user_id"`
}
```

## How to use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/niccolot/Chirpy
cd Chirpy

# for hashing functions
go getgolang.org/x/crypto

# for env variables functions
go getgithub.com/joho/godotenv

# for jwt functions
go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5

# postgres go driver
go get github.com/lib/pq

# for uuids
go get github.com/google/uuid

# for database migrations
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest

# for installing postgres, choose whatever password you want
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo passwd postgres
```

The dependencies can be installed by running the apposite script

```shell
cd scripts
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
cd ..
```

In order to function the server has to read some environment variables, the `POLKA_API_KEY` which mimics the api key usually provided by third party companies and the `JWT_SECRET` that is used for the enription of the JWTs. This is done via the `create_env_vars.sh` script

```shell
cd scripts
chmod +x create_env_vars.sh
./create_env_vars.sh
cd ..
```
After having created the `.env` file one can load the environment variables with

```shell
source .env
```
and start the server with the provided script that before compiling the project checks if postgres is active 

```shell
cd scripts
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
cd ..
```

Once the server is started one can play with it sending HTTP request from a separate terminal watching the responses. One can use the linux `curl` command or the VScode extention [thunder client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) that gives a GUI for cheking the functioning of servers.
